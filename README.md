This repository contains a buggy `Calculator` class and a JUnit 4 parameterized test that exposes the bug in one parameter and does not expose the bug in a different parameter. When JUnit 4 is used to run the test in the `expected/` subdirectory, the test fails as expected. When JUnit 5 Vintage is used to run the test in the `actual/` subdirectory, the test is erroneously marked as flaky and the build passes (erroneously) as described in [SUREFIRE-2087](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SUREFIRE-2087).
